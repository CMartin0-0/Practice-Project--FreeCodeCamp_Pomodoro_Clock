# FCC 25 + 5 Clock

This is my solution to the freeCodeCamp [25 + 5 Clock](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-25-5-clock) project. The goal was to create a Pomodoro timer that allows users to set custom session and break lengths, start/pause/reset the timer, and automatically switch between session and break modes.
